## How to Commit and Push README.md

To update your README.md on GitHub, follow these steps in your terminal or command prompt:

1. **Add the README.md file to the staging area:**
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```
   This stages your changes to README.md so they are ready to commit.

2. **Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update README.md with new application information"
   ```
   This records your changes in the repository history.

3. **Push the committed changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   This uploads your changes to the remote repository, making them visible to others.
